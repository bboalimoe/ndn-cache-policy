``sphinxcontrib.autoprogram`` --- Documenting CLI programs
==========================================================

This contrib extension, ``sphinxcontrib.autoprogram``, provides an automated
way to document CLI programs.  It scans ``arparser.ArgumentParser`` object,
and then expands it into a set of ``.. program::`` and ``.. option::``
directives.
