.. ndnSIM: NS-3 based NDN simulator documentation master file

Welcome
=======

The ndnSIM is NS-3 module that implements Named Data Networking (NDN) communication model, the clean slate Internet design. ndnSIM is specially optimized for simulation purposes and has a cleaner and more extensible internal structure comparing to the existing NDN implementation (NDNx).

We invite you to `join our mailing list <http://www.lists.cs.ucla.edu/mailman/listinfo/ndnsim>`_ to see and participate in discussions about ndnSIM implementation and simulations in general (`mailing list archives <http://www.lists.cs.ucla.edu/pipermail/ndnsim/>`_).
