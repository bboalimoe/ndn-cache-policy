Version 1.0 (2009-11-15)
------------------------

* Fix HTML builder rendering.
* Improve error reporting when aafigure package is missing.


Version 0.3 (2009-07-13)
------------------------

* Add website__.
* Change license to BOLA__.
* Add partial format redefinition via the config option ``aafig_format``.
* Add support for the text builder (using the ``None`` format).
* Add a special format ``None`` meaning not to render the figure using aafigure
  at all (just include the raw ASCII art as a literal block).
* Fix SVG support for HTML builders.
* Make aspect and scale options take a percentage instead of a float (this is
  more consistent with the image directive).
* Add support for image directive options: alt, align, width, height, class,
  target.
* Add dependency against aafigure package to ease installation.
* Improve error handling in many ways. For example, if the format is not
  supported, or if aafigure is not installed, the raw ASCII art is inserted
  into the document as a literal block.
* Fix a couple of bugs.
